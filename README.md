# CONCRETE COMPRESSION STRENGTH

## ABSTRACT

Abramsâ€™ law is commonly used to predict the compressive strength of concrete with respect to the water content of the mix, but it is largely inaccurate. High-performance concrete, with its complex additional ingredients, makes the prediction more difficult. The goal of the project is to find the most accurate model for prediction of the compressive strength of a given concrete mix using machine learning (ML). First, the various ML models are explained along with their working principles. Second, the evaluation methods used for the error analysis in the study are discussed. Third, the findings of the study are displayed and inferences are drawn from them. It is found that the neural network performs the best with the least error.

## COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH

Compressive strength of concrete is the Strength of hardened concrete measured by the compression test. The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. It is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine.The materials which determine are:
-->Cement
-->Course Aggregate
-->Fine Aggregate
-->Flyash
-->Water 
-->Superplasticizer

--This page is used to get the inputs from the user.
--Then linear regression algorithm is used to predict the compressive strength of the concrete.

## CONCLUSION
-- We infer that , the neural network model is the best model to predict the compressive strength of concrete with least error and more accuracy.
-- The other ML models can also be used for small constructions depending on the conditions.
-- We have to choose the neural network model for predicting the strength because the strength of the concrete is mandatory for a building to be strong.
